Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM
Overview
This repository implements stock price prediction using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), a type of recurrent neural network well-suited for time series data. The project predicts future stock prices based on historical data, leveraging LSTM's ability to capture temporal dependencies.

Features
Preprocessing of stock market data (e.g., scaling, sequence generation).
Implementation of LSTM-based neural networks for time series forecasting.
Support for hyperparameter tuning.
Evaluation using metrics like MAE, MSE, and RMSE.
Visualization of actual vs. predicted stock prices.
